# LSTM Model for Time Series Prediction

## Overview

This project implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for time series prediction. The LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is well-suited for sequence prediction tasks, making it particularly effective for time series data.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow (or any other deep learning library that supports LSTM)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/lstm-time-series-prediction.git
cd lstm-time-series-prediction

Certainly! A README file typically provides essential information about a project, including how to use it, what it does, and any other relevant details. Here's an example of a README file for a project involving an LSTM model:
