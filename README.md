# LSTM
# LSTM Model for Time Series Prediction

## Overview

This project implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for time series prediction. The LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is well-suited for sequence prediction tasks, making it particularly effective for time series data.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow (or any other deep learning library that supports LSTM)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
